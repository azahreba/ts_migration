Code Examples for Practical TypeScript Migration
================================================

StartOfModule2/
This is the original CoinCounter game before any conversion to TypeScript.

StartOfModule3/
This is CoinCounter after we've converted app, GameClock, and the GameClock tests.

MidModule3/
This is CoinCounter after we've converted everything to TypeScript, but have NOT done our refactoring.

StartOfModule4/
This is CoinCounter after we've converted everything to TypeScript and completed our refactoring.

EndOfModule4/
This is CoinCounter after we've implemented our Node.js build script.  Follow the instructions in "EndOfModule4/CoinCounter/readme.txt" to get the build script working (or better yet, watch the course which explains everything!!!)
